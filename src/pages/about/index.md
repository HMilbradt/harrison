title: Who Am I
---
Hey y'all, my name is Harrison.  I'm a graduate from [British Columbia Institute of Technology](<https://www.bcit.ca/>), where I took the Web and Mobile option.

### Things I Like

Traveling, food, cooking, pretty standard stuff, but nonetheless great 😁.  I also ~~like~~ love building things (like this site), learning new things, and my succulents.

### Things I don't like

Missing happy hour by 1 minute, 502 errors, and my succelents dying 😤.
