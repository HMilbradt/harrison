Hey y'all, my name is Harrison.  I'm a graduate from [British Columbia Institute of Technology](<https://www.bcit.ca/>), where I took the Web and Mobile option.

### Things I Like

Traveling, food, cooking, pretty standard stuff, but nonetheless great 😁.  I also ~~like~~ love building things (like this site), learning new things, and my succulents.

### Things I don't like

Missing happy hour by 1 minute, 502 errors, and my succulents dying 😤.

### Coffee

Thought I'd forget to mention coffee? Nope, it just gets its own section ☕️😍.  I absolutely live for coffee, HMU with a double shot espresso sometime, I'll be waiting at Pallet Coffee.
