  One year ago, I remember walking out of my teams project presentation and
  thinking "Okay, now what?".  I'm going to share some of my tips and tricks for
  surviving after graduating.

## Be Realistic

I got to watch a lot of my fellow classmates land great jobs, go off travelling, and get accepted into universities to continue their education in Computer Science.  Unfortunately, I also got to watch the opposite, and it usually came down to x reasons.

* They aren't ready to work yet
* They aren't taking it seriously
* They aren't being realistic

For the first two points, there really isn't anything anybody can do, so I won't be talking about them.  However, approaching your graduation and the opportunites realistically is something everyone has the power to do, whether you want to work in the field or not.

Of my classmates that had difficulty finding work, a lot of them thought along the lines of "I was in option X, so I'm only applying for jobs in field X".  While this happened to work out for web and mobile grads, students graduating from AI or Digital Processing options are going to have a much harder time finding work with the same line of thinking.  Why is that?

This has everything to do with supply and demand in the job market.  In Vancouver, for instance, there is a huge demand for web developers, and generally the positions don't require any formal education.  It's very easy to land your resume on the top of the pile with a few public repos and a personal project under your belt.

For those pursuing jobs that require much more specialized training, like AI, the opportunites are a lot more scarce, and the applicants are generally much more educated.

So my advice?  Cast your net wide, learn from every interview you get (or don't get), and try to land your first job as soon as you can.  Having any experience greatly increases your chances of getting the opportunites you do want.

## Post On StackOverflow

Without the structured lessons, many graduates find it difficult to keep honing their skills.  There's plenty of free courses on YouTube, paid courses on Udemy, and tons of meetups happening all the time.  But one of the single most valuable excercises for me has been posting on StackOverflow.

Whether it's a question or an answer, the process involved in articulating your thoughts so that another person can clearly understand you is so critical in the workplace.  

## Write A Blog

One of my favourite things about running a blog is that every single post you write teaches you something new.  Whether it's technical, personal, travel-related, increasing your knowledge and experience base is one of the most important parts of being a great software engineer, and one that many ignore.

There's plenty of fantastic services out there for getting a blog started, such a Medium for an already set up solution, all the way to Netlify, which is what powers this site.
