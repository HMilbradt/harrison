These days, you can't search Google for "microservices" without being bombaraded by articles claiming "Build a Serverless microservice in just 5 minutes".  The vast amount of support and tooling available is awesome, and allows you to build new apps without thinking too much about the infrastructure you need.  There's no denying the usefulness of these technologies either.
